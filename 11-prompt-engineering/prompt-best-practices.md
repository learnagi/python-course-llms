# Prompt Engineering Best Practices

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is a crucial skill in LLM application development. This guide covers advanced techniques and best practices for crafting effective prompts.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Specificity

- Be explicit about the desired output format
- Provide context and constraints
- Use clear and unambiguous language

### 2. Context Management

- Include relevant background information
- Maintain consistent context across interactions
- Handle context window limitations effectively

### 3. Task Decomposition

- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Use chain-of-thought prompting
- Implement systematic reasoning approaches

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Role-Based Prompting

```python
role_prompt = """
You are an experienced Python developer reviewing code.
Please analyze the following code snippet for:
1. Potential bugs
2. Performance improvements
3. Best practice violations

Code:
{code}
"""
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning

```python
few_shot_prompt = """
Convert these sentences to SQL queries:

Example 1:
Input: "Find all users who joined after 2023"
Output: SELECT * FROM users WHERE join_date >= '2023-01-01';

Example 2:
Input: "Count total orders by each customer"
Output: SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as total_orders FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;

Now convert this:
Input: "{user_input}"
"""
```

### 3. Template-Based Prompting

```python
from string import Template

code_review_template = Template("""
Review Scope: $scope
Focus Areas:
1. $area1
2. $area2
3. $area3

Code to Review:
$code
""")
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Temperature Control

- Use lower temperatures (0.1-0.3) for factual/consistent responses
- Use higher temperatures (0.7-0.9) for creative tasks

### 2. Token Management

```python
def optimize_prompt_tokens(prompt, max_tokens=4000):
    """Optimize prompt to fit within token limits"""
    # Implementation details
    pass
```

### 3. Response Validation

```python
def validate_llm_response(response, expected_format):
    """Validate LLM response against expected format"""
    # Implementation details
    pass
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Instruction Refinement

```python
base_instruction = "Analyze the following text"
refined_instruction = f"{base_instruction} and provide:
1. Key themes
2. Sentiment analysis
3. Main entities mentioned"
```

### 2. Error Handling

```python
def handle_prompt_errors(prompt_response):
    """Handle common prompt-related errors"""
    if not prompt_response:
        return "Error: No response received"
    # Additional error handling
    return prompt_response
```

## Best Practices Checklist

1. ✅ Clear and specific instructions
2. ✅ Consistent formatting
3. ✅ Appropriate context inclusion
4. ✅ Error handling mechanisms
5. ✅ Response validation
6. ✅ Token optimization
7. ✅ Documentation of prompt patterns

## Evaluation and Testing

### 1. Prompt Testing Framework

```python
def test_prompt_effectiveness(prompt, test_cases):
    """Test prompt against various test cases"""
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        response = get_llm_response(prompt.format(**case))
        results.append(evaluate_response(response, case['expected']))
    return results
```

### 2. Metrics for Evaluation

- Response relevance
- Output consistency
- Task completion rate
- Token efficiency
- Error rate

## Conclusion

Effective prompt engineering requires a combination of clear communication, systematic approach, and continuous optimization. Use these patterns and practices as a foundation for developing robust LLM applications.
